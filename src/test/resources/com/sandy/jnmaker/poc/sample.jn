@definition "Physical changes"
"Physical changes are those changes which are associated with the object's physical
properties.

E.g. tearing paper, washing clothes etc"

@definition "Chemical change"
"A chemical change depends upon the change in the composition of substances. The
new substances formed after the change is different from it's original reactants.

E.g. Burning of paper, ripening of a fruit, rusting of iron etc."
 
@definition "Differentiate between physical and chemical changes"

Physical change                                  | Chemical change
-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------
Mostly Reversible                                | Mostly irreversible
Change is temporary                              | Change is Permanent
The composition remains unaltered                | The composition is altered
No gain or loss of energy                        | Energy is either absorbed or evolved
The mass of the substance remains the same       | The mass of the substance changes

@fib "Energy is either absorbed or evolved during a {0} change." "chemical"

@definition "Endothermic change"
"When a chemical change takes place with absorption of heat energy, the change
is said to be Endothermic change."

@definition "Exothermic change"
"When a chemical change takes place with release of heat energy, the change
is said to be Endothermic change."

@qa "When does a chemical reaction between two substances take place?"
"A chemical reaction between two substances takes place when the particles of
the two substances come together in close contact or by supplying energy to the
mixture of substances."

@qa "Why do powdered substances react more vigorously?"
"Powdered substances have significantly more surface area and hence larger number
of particles come in contact with one another, leading to a vigorous reaction."

@qa "How can reactions triggered by close contact be accelerated?"
"Reactions involving close contact can be accelerated by:

1. Grinding the substances into powdered form before being mixed
2. Mixing the substances, or at least one of the substances in solution form"

@rtc {
    context "Give reasons why"
    
    @qa "Heating accelerates chemical reactions."
    "Heating initiates the reacting particles to move faster and collide more
     frequently and hence accelerates the reaction."
     
    @qa "Some reactions are influenced by the presence of light."
    "Molecules of certain substances upon absorbing light energy become activated
     and react rapidly."
     
    @qa "Many reactions are brought about by passage of electric current."
    "Electricity directs the charged particles [ions] to opposite electrodes,
     thus severing the chemical bonds and causing chemical changes."
     
    @qa "Some chemical reactions takes place on subjecting the reactants to pressure."
    "Reacting molecules agglomerate under sudden high pressure or heat due to
     friction, leading to a chemical reaction."

@qa "Why is a chemical change associated with evolution or absorption of energy?"

reactants and products. This energy is in the form of heat, light or electricity."

@definition "Burning or Combustion"
"Burning or Combustion is a chemical reaction involving oxidation i.e. combination
of substances with oxygen or air, generally accompanied by the production of heat
and light."

@qa "Why is burning or combustion considered a chemical change?"
"Burining or combustion is considered a chemical change because:

1. New substances are produced
2. The change is permanent
3. The mass of the burning substance changes
4. Energy in the form of heat and light is released"

@qa "What are the conditions required for burning?"
"
1. A combustible substance
2. An environment which is a supporter of combustion
3. Appropriate ignition temperature"

@definition "Combustible substance"
"A substance which can burn in air or oxygen is called a combustible substance.

Example - coal, coke, wood, petrol, phosphorus, alcohol, paper."

Example - sand, stone, gold, lead bromide"

@qa "What are **acid anhydrides**?"
"Non-metals combine with oxygen to form their respective oxides. For example

(dissolved in water).

"When a candle burns the mass of the products are greater than the mass of the 
original candle wax. Therefore there is a gain the mass when a candle burns in
air."

@qa "What is **respiration**?"
"Respiration is the process whereby living things use oxygen from air to 
oxidize food substances [mainly glucose] in their body cells and release energy
in the form of heat, along with carbon dioxide and water vapour.

$$ \\ce{ C6H12O6 + 6O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy } $$"

@qa "Why is respiration a chemical change?"

@qa "What is Carbon Cycle?"
"Large amounts of both Oxygen and Carbon dioxide are added to and removed from
the atmosphere via various natural and man made processes, example:

* Addition
    - Oxygen - Photosynthesis
    - Carbon dioxide - Respiration, Burning, Organic decay
* Removal
    - Oxygen - Respiration, Burning, Organic decay, Rusting
    - Carbon dioxide - Photosynthesis, Setting of mortar

As a result the %age of CO2 and O2 remain practically constant due to the never
ending cycle. This cycle is called the **Carbon Cycle**."
